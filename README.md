# MBTA-Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) subway and bus services, aiming to provide insights into ridership patterns, identify underserved areas, and highlight opportunities for service improvements. Utilizing the MBTA Dataset, the analysis encompasses over 700,000 data points, including detailed information on boarding, alighting, and load data across various routes, seasons, and time periods.

## Features
* Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Tableau and PowerBI to create dynamic dashboards, offering users the ability to explore data through filters such as line, time period, and location.  
* Comprehensive Dataset: Analysis based on extensive data, including boarding, alighting, total ons aned offs, segmented by time period, season, and route.  
* Data Insights: Highlights critical findings, such as high-density routes, peak usage times, and areas needing service enhancements.

## How It Helps  
* Identifies under-served and over-crowded areas, supporting infrastructure and service planning.  
* Enables public education on the current state of the MBTA system and available resources.  
* Provides a foundation for future studies on public transportation improvements.

## Data Visualizations and Insights
This analysis includes detailed Tableau dashboards that provide a deep dive into MBTA's service usage patterns:

* Route Density Analysis: Visualizations highlight the flow density across major MBTA routes, including the Blue, Green, Orange, and Red Lines. This allows us to identify the most heavily utilized segments and times of day, aiding in targeted service improvements.  

* Average Flow by Time Period: We examine passenger flow during various parts of the day, such as AM Peak, Midday, PM Peak, and Late Evening. Insights from this analysis help understand peak usage times and potential off-peak service optimization opportunities.  

* Total Ons and Offs by Stop Name: This dashboard segment provides a detailed look at boarding and alighting figures across key MBTA stops, offering a granular view of demand patterns and hotspot locations.  

* Locational Distribution and Seasonal Impact: By analyzing the density of flow based on day type and season, we uncover significant variations in ridership, informing seasonal service adjustments to better meet passenger needs.  

* These visualizations are instrumental in understanding the complex dynamics of public transportation usage in the Greater Boston area and form the basis for our recommendations on enhancing MBTA services.
